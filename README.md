## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each planet page and toggle between "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology"

### Screenshot

![](./ScreenShot.gif)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- [Expo](https://expo.io/) - A great framework to build React native apps. Really makes the process so much easier.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - A state management library.

### What I learned

Well, I learned to develop native apps!

I didn't know it will be so easy to learn, thanks to my knowledge in React it was really a piece of cake!

Of course there is much more to learn!

### Continued development

There is so much I would like to implement in this app :)
First of all because I was in a hurry to finish it in only one week, I did not do any tests or write any stories. I should add those.

Also It would be great to add auth and ordering functionality.

There some minor fixing in the UI/UX.

### Useful resources

- [React Native official docs](https://reactnative.dev/) - I really like the Reacts' team official docs they are informative and easy to understand.
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) - This is an amazing library of great docs.
