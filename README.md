## Overview

### The challenge

Functional Requirements

- A user can have more than one Agwa Farm device.
- Users can select which vegetables they order for each of their devices.
- Users can select the quantity for each vegetable.
- Vegetables are visually grouped according to categories.
- Users can see the title and image of each vegetable.
- When users tap on a vegetable, they can see its description on a separate screen.
- Restarting the app takes the user back to the screen they were on.
- Restarting the app does not cause it to lose the userâ€™s order.

### Built with

- [Expo](https://expo.io/) - A great framework to build React native apps. Really makes the process so much easier.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - A state management library.

### What I learned

Well, I learned to develop native apps!

I didn't know it will be so easy to learn, thanks to my knowledge in React it was really a piece of cake!

Of course there is much more to learn!

### Continued development

There is so much I would like to implement in this app :)
First of all because I was in a hurry to finish it in only one week, I did not do any tests or write any stories. I should add those.

Also It would be great to add auth and ordering functionality.

There some minor fixing in the UI/UX.

### Useful resources

- [React Native official docs](https://reactnative.dev/) - I really like the Reacts' team official docs they are informative and easy to understand.
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) - This is an amazing library of great docs.
